# Genevieve Naa Teteley Quarshie - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About Me

Hi, I'm Genevieve!
I'm a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in Business Intelligence and a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive decision-making.

With hands-on experience in Power BI, SQL, Advanced Excel, and Python, I’ve developed dashboards, automated reports, and conducted data analysis that directly supports business goals. I’m particularly drawn to using data to uncover trends, optimize performance, and solve real-world problems.

I hold a PL-300: Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification and have contributed to impactful projects across sales analytics, environmental data analysis, financial performance tracking, and process optimization.

Alongside my technical skills, I bring a detail-oriented and solution-driven mindset. Whether it’s writing Business Requirements Documents (BRDs), managing tasks with DevOps, or handling customer tickets via SysAid, I value collaboration, continuous learning, and clear communication.

In my free time, I enjoy diving into new datasets, building dashboards, and learning new tools that make data storytelling even more powerful.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section, I will list the analytics projects I have worked on, briefly describing the technology used in solving business problems identified.


### Financial Analysis Dashboard

**View Power BI Report:** [Financial Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/EvieQ22/Evie-Portfolio/blob/main/Financial_Performance_Analysis.pbix)

**Goal:** To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes the financial health and structure of selected companies using balance sheet data.

**Description:** This project involved creating a three-page Power BI report that explored the financial performance, asset-liability structure, and liquidity-leverage ratios of approximately 20 selected stocks. Drawing on balance sheet data, the report enables users to interactively analyze total assets, liabilities, equity, and key financial ratios over time. Each page of the dashboard offers visual insights into key focus areas: a Financial Overview, Asset and Liability Composition, and Liquidity and Leverage Analysis.

**Skills:** 
- Data modeling
- Financial data analysis
- Storytelling with data
- DAX calculations
- KPI development
- Data visualization
- Dashboard design

**Technology:** 
- Power Query
- Power BI
- DAX

**Results:**
- Designed over 12 insightful visuals, including KPI cards, treemaps, waterfall, stacked/clustered bar charts, donut charts, and gauge visuals

- Created custom DAX measures for financial ratios like current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-equity, and debt-to-assets

- Enabled dynamic filtering by year and company stock, enhancing interactivity and user exploration

- Improved understanding of financial reporting and performance benchmarking, with practical relevance for business stakeholders


### Water Quality Analysis Report

**View Power BI Report:** [Water Quality Analysis Report](https://github.com/EvieQ22/Evie-Portfolio/blob/main/Water_Quality_Analysis.pbix)

**Goal:** To analyze the quality of water samples collected across several monitoring stations to identify pollution trends and assess environmental health.

**Description:** This project involved exploring a rich environmental dataset containing key water quality indicators such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels. The aim was to uncover patterns in water pollution events, assess the impact of surrounding land use types (urban, agricultural, forest), and understand how various environmental factors affect aquatic life. The Power BI report delivers an interactive, insight-driven dashboard that highlights areas with recurring pollution events and declining fish populations.
